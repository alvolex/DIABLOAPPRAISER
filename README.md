## Diablo appraiser

This is an app that uses OCR to automatically detect when an item is hovered in the inventory and/or stash and then saves a snapshot of the items data so that items with certain stats can be easily searched for without having to go through all items in the inventory/stash.

This project is built on top of the React-electron foundation, and then a custom module is used to communicate with the OS to provide the overlay position.
